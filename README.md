# Guardian Digital Department Website

A digital fellowship scheme project.

A play app with react frontend to provide information on what it is like to work at Guardian Digital.

* List of recent/future talks by current employees.
* List of open source projects created / incubated by the Guardian.
* List of events run by Guardian Digital.

Once finished it will:

* Replace http://developers.theguardian.com/ and http://guardian.github.io/developers/ and move focus from developers only to wider Digital department.
* Act as a compliment to: https://workforus.theguardian.com/.
